# Ethical Considerations

Ethical hacking must be conducted responsibly and legally.

*   **Legal Compliance:** Always obtain explicit permission before performing any security assessments or penetration tests on systems or networks.
*   **Scope Definition:** Clearly define the scope of your engagement with the client, specifying which systems and networks are authorized for testing.
*   **Data Handling:** Protect sensitive data discovered during testing. Follow strict data handling procedures and comply with relevant privacy regulations.
*   **Reporting:** Provide clear and concise reports to the client, outlining identified vulnerabilities and recommended remediation steps.
