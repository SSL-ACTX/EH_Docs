Research the VPN provider's logging policy. Look for independent audits to verify their claims.</li> <li>Jurisdiction: The VPN provider's location (country) matters.

This adds an extra layer of encryption and makes it harder to link your Tor traffic to your real IP address.  Be aware this can further reduce speed.

Consider disabling it in your browser (especially when using Tor), or use NoScript or similar browser extensions.</li> <li>Use Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Protect your accounts with strong, unique passwords and enable 2FA whenever possible.</li> <li>Be Mindful of Metadata: Be aware that documents, images, and other files may contain metadata that can reveal your identity or location. Remove metadata before sharing files.</li> <li>Virtual Machines (VMs): Use a virtual machine to isolate your ethical hacking activities from your main operating system. This can help prevent malware from infecting your host system.</li> <li>Regularly Update Software: Keep your operating system, browser, and other software up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.</li> <li>Avoid Using Personal Accounts: When conducting ethical hacking activities, avoid using your personal email, social media, or other personal accounts.
